>>> #Number System Conversion
>>> #Binary, Decimal, Octal, HexaDecimal Systems
>>> 
>>> #MAC address (Media Access Control address) use HexaDecimal 12digit number assigned to each device connected to the network
>>> 
>>> #IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) - provides the unique IP addresses necessary for Internet-enabled devices to communicate also use HexaDecimal System
>>> 
>>> #To Convert Decimal System to Binary I use function bin()
>>> 
>>> bin(25)
'0b11001'
>>> 
>>> # In Decimal system numbers are from 0 - 9 (10 digits)
>>> # In Binary system numbers are from 0 - 1 ( 2 digits)
>>> # In Octal system numbers are from 0 - 7 (8 digits)
>>> # In HexaDecimal system numbers are from 0 - 9 a - f (16 digits)
>>> 
>>> bin(25)
'0b11001'
>>> 
>>> # 0b means its a Binary format and the rest it's the number 25 = 11001
>>> 
>>> oct(25)
'0o31'
>>> 
>>> # 0o means it's a Octal format and the rest is the number 25 = 31
>>> 
>>> hex(25)
'0x19'
>>> 
>>> # 0x means it's a HexaDecimal format and the rest is the number 25 = 19
>>> 
>>> hex(10)
